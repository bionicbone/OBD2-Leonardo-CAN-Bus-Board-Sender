# OBD2-Leonardo-Sender
Working at full speed !!! :)

This code has been used to simulate a send of a CAN signal on the HS_CAN Bus (500kb/s) for the Land Rover Freelander 2 sniffing project

Given it uses the Leonardo it is significantly faster than the Nano with HW-184, in fact it almost saturates the CAN Bus.
